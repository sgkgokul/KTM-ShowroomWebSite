        <h2>Properly Charge Your E - Bike Batteries</h2>
        <p>If you fully discharge a lithium battery , it reduces its ability to hold a charge .<br>
        That results in a diminished capacity . It's best to keep a lithium battery charged . Plug it in after a ride ,<br>
        even if you've only gone a few miles . If you do empty the entire charge on a battery , you should recharge it as soon as you can .</p>
        <h2>Use the Charger Provided</h2>
        <p>
            Don't mix and match chargers . Only use the charger that came with your e - bike or conversion . It's possible to <br>
            cause an explosion and fire by using the wrong charger .
        </p>
        <h2>Fully Charge Your Battery Before Your First Ride </h2>
        <p>
            When you get a new e - bike or conversion kit fully charge the battery before your first ride . <br>
            Follow the instructions in the owner's manual . A full charge may take four to eight hours .
        </p>
        <h2>Don't Regularly Fully Discharge Your Battery</h2>
        <p>As mentioned earlier , you shouldn't fully discharge your e bike batteries on a regular basis . <br>
            Discharging lithium - ion batteries to 0 % is harmful . The batteries don't have a charge memory </p>
        <h2>Create the Best Environment for Your Battery</h2>
        <p>Try not to expose your e - bike batteries to high heat , sub - freezing temperatures , water , or high humidity .<br>
             Avoid shock , vibration , and punctures . The better the environment the longer your battery will perform at capacity .</p>
        <h2>Stay Away from Extreme Temperatures</h2>
        <p>Extreme hot or cold temperatures will hurt performance . Lithium batteries like cooler temperatures .<br>
             If you want to extend your electric bicycle battery life , don't let it get hot . Warm is alright ,<br>
              but hot to the touch is bad . The recommended temperatures for storing your batteries are between and 32°F to 77°F .</p>
