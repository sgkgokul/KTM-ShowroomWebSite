                    their closing timing which is longer than any other KTM showroom in the city and they were kind enough to wait beyond <br>
                    8:00 so that i could have a look at what they had to offer . The delivery time was too minimal. "

            Start them with a speed similar to what they can push the non-powered version at, and they<br> <br>
        learn the use of the twist throttle, and a long coast turn into a constant use of throttle<br> <br>
